        <p> The Real Stories Behind 5 Classic Horror Movies</p>

        <ol>
            <li>'Nosferatu' (1922)
            <p> The 1922 German film Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror is basically an unauthorized knock-off of Bram
                Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. The filmmakers never reached out to Stoker's widow to secure the film
                rights, so they made certain changes. Instead of Count Dracula, the main villain is Count Orlok.</p>
            </li>
            

            <li>'The Exorcist' (1973)
            <p>In August 1949, The Washington Post ran at least two stories about a 14-year-old boy’s exorcism in
                Maryland. In one, the newspaper reported, “the boy broke into a violent tantrum of screaming, cursing
                and voicing of Latin phrases—a language he had never studied.” The story inspired author William Peter
                Blatty’s 1971 novel The Exorcist, the basis for the 1973 film in which a young Linda Blair
                projectile-vomits pea soup.</p>
            </li>
            

            <li>'The Amityville Horror' (1979)
            <p> On November 13, 1974, 23-year-old Ronald “Butch” DeFeo Jr. murdered his entire family in their sleep.
                One year later, the Lutz family purchased the house in Amityville, New York where the horror took place.
                .</p>
            </li>
            

            <li>'The Serpent and the Rainbow' (1988) 
            <p>In 1985, a white American graduate student named Wade Davis published a book with an extremely long
                title: The Serpent and the Rainbow: A Harvard Scientist's Astonishing Journey into the Secret Societies
                of Haitian Voodoo, Zombies, and Magic.</p>
            </li>
            

            <li>'The Conjuring' (2013), et al.
            <p> Ed and Lorriane Warren promoted so many hauntings during their decades-long careers that they became
                horror movie characters themselves. Actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have portrayed the couple in
                The Conjuring (2013), The Conjuring 2 (2016), The Nun (2018) and Annabelle Comes Home (2019), and will
                appear again in The Conjuring 3 (2020).</p>
            </li>

        </ol>


        <p> How do you make a horror tale scarier? Just say it’s “based on a true story.” That’s a technique book
            publishers and movie producers have been using for decades, whether or not the supposedly “true story”
            adds up.

            Some movies are inspired by what might be called “real hoaxes”—made-up stories that people have
            believed. Others draw inspiration from unexplained behavior or folklore. Read about how the story of a
            troubled teen inspired a movie about demon possession, how a series of hoaxes launched a major movie
            franchise and how centuries-old folklore about disease gave way to a classic Hollywood villain.</p>

        <h2>Halloween Franchise</h2>
        <p>Speaking of commercial success, scary Halloween movies have a long history of being box office hits. Classic
            Halloween movies include the “Halloween” franchise, based on the 1978 original film directed by John
            Carpenter and starring Donald Pleasance, Nick Castle, Jamie Lee Curtis and Tony Moran. In “Halloween,” a
            young boy named Michael Myers murders his 17-year-old sister and is committed to jail, only to escape as a
            teen on Halloween night and seek out his old home, and a new target. A direct sequel to the original
            "Halloween" was released in 2018, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle. A sequel to that, "Halloween
            Kills," was released in 2021; and a sequel to that, "Halloween Ends," was released in 2022.

            Considered a classic horror film down to its spooky soundtrack, "Halloween" inspired other iconic “slasher
            films” like “Scream,” “Nightmare on Elm Street” and “Friday the 13.” More family-friendly Halloween movies
            include “Hocus Pocus,” “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Beetlejuice” and “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie
            Brown.</p>
