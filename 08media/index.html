        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31. The tradition <strong>originated</strong>, with
            the ancient Celtic festival of <em>Samhain</em>
            when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III
            designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the
            traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time,
            Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive
            gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats. .</p>
        <p>When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier that
            evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.</p>
        <p>This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year
            that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the
            boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they
            celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.</p>

        <h2>History of Trick-or-Treating</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Borrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking
                for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition. Young women
                believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband by doing
                tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.

                In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and
                neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn of the century, Halloween
                parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. Parties focused on
                games, foods of the season and festive costumes.</li>
            <li>Did you know? One-quarter of all the candy sold annually in the U.S. is purchased for Halloween.</li>
